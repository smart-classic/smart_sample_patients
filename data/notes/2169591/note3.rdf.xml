            <rdf:value><![CDATA[I saw this patient in the ED briefly along with Dr. Gladd.  I
interviewed and examined the patient myself.  I have read through
the resident chart.  I have discussed the diagnosis,
disposition, and plan with the patient.  Please see the resident
note for full details.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 26-year-old
female with asthma status, now on Flowvent and Acyclovir, 
and multiple other medications who has been having nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea x1 day.  It sounds
like a gastroenteritis.  This has been going through her
household, her mother had it recently.  She has been unable to
keep up with her fluid losses.  At an outside institution, she was
found to be very dehydrated. She received IV fluids and was transferred here.   
She had to go to the bathroom in the ER a couple times but did not complain of 
any pain.  Her heart rate was down into 114 and her blood pressure
was normal.  She left the ER after IV treatment and antibiotics
without incident for further management of her dehydration.
DIAGNOSES:
1.  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
2.  Dehydration.
Admitted to the ER in stable condition.
For the rest of the elements, please see the documentation in Dr.
Gladds note.
